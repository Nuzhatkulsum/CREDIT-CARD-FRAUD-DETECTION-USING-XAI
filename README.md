# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-USING-XAI

### INTRODUCTION:
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task for financial institutions, aiming to identify fraudulent transactions and protect customers from financial loss. Traditional fraud detection systems rely on predefined rules, which often struggle to detect new or evolving fraud patterns. Machine learning (ML) models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, have been successfully employed to enhance fraud detection by learning from historical transaction data.

However, while these models are effective in predicting fraud, they are often seen as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This is where Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) come into play. These methods help provide transparency by explaining the model's predictions in a human-understandable way. SHAP, for example, breaks down the contribution of each feature (e.g., transaction amount, location, and user behavior) to the final prediction, while LIME focuses on creating simpler local models to explain individual predictions.

By combining ML models with XAI techniques, financial institutions can not only improve the accuracy of fraud detection but also gain valuable insights into how and why certain transactions are flagged as fraudulent, ensuring greater trust and accountability in the system.
